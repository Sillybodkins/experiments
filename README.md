# Experiments

## October 25-31, 2015
### We Thought
* Messaging 50 gottaGolf users results in 3 (>6%) customer development interviews.
* Messaging 60 members of the Austin Golfers Meetup results in 3 (5%) customer development interviews.

### We Did
* Sent 139 gottaGolf friend requests to uses in the state of Texas. This resulted in 16 **(12%)** friends.
* Messaged 80 members of the Austin Golfers Meetup sorted by the most recent to join. This resulted in one (.01%) interview, five (.06%) conversations in progress and two (.03%) requests for no further contact.
* Paid the $5 yearly Meetup fee.

### We Learned
* gottaGolf is super buggy. You have to send a friend request before messaging. Some accounts may be seeded (fake). However, the 12% rate of new friends to requests is a good signal.
* Meetup allows you to send more than 12 messages per day now. There is a delay where you have to wait a few minutes after sending 10. It is not that long. I have not figure out what the new maximum is.
* The inteview with [Chris Beale](https://github.com/Sillybodkins/interviews/blob/master/chrisBeale.md) was extrmely valuable. He validated it is difficult finding people to play with and he doesnâ€™t want to mess with technology on the course. He said that front, middle and back yardages are more important closer to the hole and it would be nice to have a button to order food & beverage on the course. He is also interested in participating in a beta program. This contact was made #IRL.

### Next Steps
* Iterate: Duplicate the [experiment](https://trello.com/c/PuSb6Ses/80-send-gottagolf-friend-requests) to add more friends. Create [new experiment](https://trello.com/c/JrLWaIO1/81-message-gottagolf-users) to send existing friends requests for interviews.
* Persevere: Run the [same experiment](https://trello.com/c/JizNbfD2/82-message-members-of-austin-golfers-meetup) to get more data.

## October 18-24, 2015
### We Thought
* Messaging 99 GolfMatch users results in 10 (>10%) customer development interviews.
* Messaging 60 members of the Austin Golfers Meetup results in 3 (5%) customer development interviews.

### We Did
* Messaged 30 GolfMatch users within 50 miles of Austin, TX. This resulted in only one interview (3.33%). However, we discovered and confirmed messaging is currently extremely difficult to use.
* Messaged 35 members of the Austin Golfers Meetup sorted by the most recent to join. This resulted in only one reponse (2.86%).
* The Meetup has a $5 yearly fee. The most recent members to join may not be active yet in the group.

### We Learned
* The inteview with [Catherine](https://github.com/Sillybodkins/interviews/blob/master/catherineLannAndrews.md) was extrmely valuable. However, it is too hard for users to respond to messages right now to continue to test with this channel. We should try the experiment again when GolfMatch messaging improves.

### Next Steps
* Iterate: Duplicate the [experiment using gottaGolf](https://trello.com/c/5cVDYZmN/66-message-gottagolf-users).
* Persevere: Run the [same experiment](https://trello.com/c/Td1ssk5E/67-message-members-of-austin-golfers-meetup) to get more data.
