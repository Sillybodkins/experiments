# Experiments

## October 18-24, 2015
### We Thought
Messaging 99 GolfMatch users results in 10 (>10%) customer development interviews.

### We Did
Messaged 30 GolfMatch users within 50 miles of Austin, TX. This resulted in only one interview (3.33%). However, we discovered and confirmed messaging is currently extrmely difficult to use.

### We Learned
The inteview with [Catherine](https://github.com/Sillybodkins/interviews/blob/master/catherineLannAndrews.md) was extrmely valuable. However, it is too hard for users to respond to messages right now to continue to test with this channel. We should try the experiment again when GolfMatch messaging improves.

### Next Steps
Duplicate the experiment using gottaGolf.
