# Experiments

## October 18-24, 2015
### We Thought
* Messaging 99 GolfMatch users results in 10 (>10%) customer development interviews.
* Messaging 60 members of the Austin Golfers Meetup will result in 3 (5%) customer development interviews.

### We Did
* Messaged 30 GolfMatch users within 50 miles of Austin, TX. This resulted in only one interview (3.33%). However, we discovered and confirmed messaging is currently extrmely difficult to use.
* Messaged 35 members of the Austin Golfers Meetup sorted by the most recent to join. This resulted in only one reponse (2.86%).

### We Learned
* The inteview with [Catherine](https://github.com/Sillybodkins/interviews/blob/master/catherineLannAndrews.md) was extrmely valuable. However, it is too hard for users to respond to messages right now to continue to test with this channel. We should try the experiment again when GolfMatch messaging improves.
* The Meetup has a $5 yearly fee. The most recent members to join may not be active yet in the group.

### Next Steps
* Iterate: Duplicate the experiment using gottaGolf.
* Persevere: Run the same experiment to get more data.
