# Experiments

## November 1-7, 2015
### We Thought
* Sending 100 gottaGolf friend requests results in 10 (10%) friends.
* Messaging 60 members of the Austin Golfers Meetup results in 3 (5%) customer development interviews.

### We Did
* Sent 100 gottaGolf friend requests to users in the state of Texas. This resulted in 12 **(12%)** new friends.
* Messaged 60 members of the Austin Golfers Meetup sorted by the most recent to join. This resulted in no interviews and 1 new conversation.

### We Learned
* A [quick call with Gary](https://github.com/Sillybodkins/interviews/blob/master/gary.md) revealed he does not have any problems finding people to play with and enjoys meeting new people. He uses both a rangefinder and a GPS watch while playing. His ideal solution would be a chip in the flag that lets you know exactly where it is.
* [Sunrise Calendar](https://sunrise.am/) integrates calendars nicely and makes it easy to send availability. But it does not allow you to send the same URL to multiple people or collect telephone numbers.
* Second week in a row with a 12% friend rate on gottaGolf.
* Being more honest about the app in the first message on Meetup did not improve results.

### Next Steps
#### Persevere
* Continue [gottaGolf friend requests](https://trello.com/c/ZGVkM5GZ/94-send-gottagolf-friend-requests) for all Texas users.

#### Iterate
* Continue [contacting Austin Golfers Meetup](https://trello.com/c/h9S5w72B/95-message-members-of-austin-golfers-meetup). 

## October 25-31, 2015
### We Thought
* Messaging 50 gottaGolf users results in 3 (>6%) customer development interviews.
* Messaging 60 members of the Austin Golfers Meetup results in 3 (5%) customer development interviews.

### We Did
* Sent 139 gottaGolf friend requests to users in the state of Texas. This resulted in 16 **(12%)** friends.
* Messaged 80 members of the Austin Golfers Meetup sorted by the most recent to join. This resulted in one (.01%) interview, five (.06%) conversations in progress and two (.03%) requests for no further contact.
* Paid the $5 yearly Meetup fee.

### We Learned
* gottaGolf is super buggy. You have to send a friend request before messaging. Some accounts may be seeded (fake). However, the 12% rate of new friends to requests is a good signal.
* Meetup allows you to send more than 12 messages per day now. There is a delay where you have to wait a few minutes after sending 10. It is not that long. I have not figure out what the new maximum is.
* The GolfMatch app may have improved their messaging. There is now a badge indicating there are messages on the Profile icon. Tapping this brings up a Chats option taking you to conversations in progress. 
* The inteview with [Chris Beale](https://github.com/Sillybodkins/interviews/blob/master/chrisBeale.md) was extrmely valuable. He validated it is difficult finding people to play with and he doesnâ€™t want to mess with technology on the course. He said that front, middle and back yardages are more important closer to the hole and it would be nice to have a button to order food & beverage on the course. He is also interested in participating in a beta program. This contact was made #IRL.

### Next Steps
#### Persevere
* Run the experiment to [send gottaGolf friend requests](https://trello.com/c/PuSb6Ses/80-send-gottagolf-friend-requests) again to add more friends.
* Run the experiment to [message members of Austin Golfers Meetup](https://trello.com/c/JizNbfD2/82-message-members-of-austin-golfers-meetup) again to get more data.

#### Iterate
* Create experiment to [message GolfMatch users](https://trello.com/c/wFxCS6aV/83-message-golfmatch-users) to send follow-up messages.
* Create experiment to [follow-up with members of Austin Golfers Meetup](https://trello.com/c/aeg5G45u/84-follow-up-with-members-of-austin-golfers-meetup).
* Create experiment to [message GolfMatch users](https://trello.com/c/M2ZqJSKm/85-message-golfmatch-users) to test the messaging improvements.

## October 18-24, 2015
### We Thought
* Messaging 99 GolfMatch users results in 10 (>10%) customer development interviews.
* Messaging 60 members of the Austin Golfers Meetup results in 3 (5%) customer development interviews.

### We Did
* Messaged 30 GolfMatch users within 50 miles of Austin, TX. This resulted in only one interview (3.33%). However, we discovered and confirmed messaging is currently extremely difficult to use.
* Messaged 35 members of the Austin Golfers Meetup sorted by the most recent to join. This resulted in only one reponse (2.86%).
* The Meetup has a $5 yearly fee. The most recent members to join may not be active yet in the group.

### We Learned
* The inteview with [Catherine](https://github.com/Sillybodkins/interviews/blob/master/catherineLannAndrews.md) was extrmely valuable. However, it is too hard for users to respond to messages right now to continue to test with this channel. We should try the experiment again when GolfMatch messaging improves.

### Next Steps
* Iterate: Duplicate the [experiment using gottaGolf](https://trello.com/c/5cVDYZmN/66-message-gottagolf-users).
* Persevere: Run the [same experiment](https://trello.com/c/Td1ssk5E/67-message-members-of-austin-golfers-meetup) to get more data.
